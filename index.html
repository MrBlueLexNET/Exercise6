    <div id="content">
        A stunning new restoration of one of the most enigmatic and distinctive films ever made,
        astounding collaboration between director Alain Resnais and leading French novelist Alain Robbe-Grillet is a key moment in the French New Wave.
        In a baroque spa hotel, an unnamed sophisticate attempts to persuade a similarly unnamed married woman that they have not onlypreviously met,
        but that they were also romantically involvedand had planned to elope together.
        The woman recalls no such encounter and so begins a sensual and philosophical examination of the uncertainty of truth. 
        Strikingly composed and beautifully shot in Cinemascope by Sacha Vierny, Last Year in Marienbad hypnotically merges chronology to radically blur the boundaries of reality and fantasy.
        A seductive and utterly fascinating cinematic puzzle, the film has been astonishing audiences for over forty years.
